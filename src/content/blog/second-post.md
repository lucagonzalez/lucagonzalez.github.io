This is going to be my second post. I have no idea what I will talk about in here, probably my experience of going from
Kotlin back to Java, as someone who hasn't used Java like, at all.

I think this will be a great post to write and will help me understand both languages better.

I can also write about my gratitude API, when I have at least a 1.0 version done. I think that will take a bit tho, I
ain't progressing much to be fair.
