## The weird beginning

I have been working with Kotlin for quite a while now. After getting my first job as a Software Developer, I felt
completely miserable writing Javascript for a living and after only a couple of months on my first job I moved into a
company that was using Spring + Kotlin.

While I was studying multiplatform development on a "vocational school", kind of, I fell in love for statically typed
programming languages the first day I started using them. Until that point I had only used Javascript (in school) and
Ruby (outside school). I didn't know that I could rely on the piece of software I was using to code so much that it
would tell me if I was making wrong assumptions about any data I was handling.

I remember going from Javascript (and Ruby but in a lesser extend) and Sublime Text to C# and Visual Studio. My life
changed at that precise moment. I fell in love with C#. The funny thing is, most of the people studying with me hate
it. I can remember vividly their faces when I got too excited when talking about types and compile time type safety.

After tinkering for a while with ~~microsoft java~~ C# and Visual Studio, we got introduced to Java and Eclipse. I hated
Eclipse from the start. It felt terrible in 2020. Java was not my favorite thing either, as it felt way worse than C#
for me personally. I think Eclipse and the subject that was using Java + Eclipse played a big part into that feeling I
had with Java at the beginning. Things started to go better when I used IntelliJ for the first time.

I remember my final exam for that specific Java subject. We had to create Java sockets and do something with them, but I
can't remember why exactly. I was the only one in class using IntelliJ while everyone else used Eclipse. I got the hang
of it so well that I was the only one actually debugging his code instead of using prints to understand what was going
on. Also, I have the sensation that code completion was way better, and that, coupled with the ability to look up the
documentation directly inside the editor, was the solely reason I passed the exam.

Then I started working with Kotlin and everything changed. I forgot everything about C# and Java. I loved it from the
beginning. I had to wrote loads of HTML DSL with Kotlin Databases, deployments, monitoring, db migrations, complex
queries, you name it. I had a blast. I would code at work, read about code at lunch, write some more code, read books
about code when I got home, and even dream about code.

Since then, I never stopped using Kotlin. Sometimes it was not my primary language at work, as I had other things to do,
but Kotlin was always there, waiting for me with open arms after long days writing Dart. However, that is about to
change now. I changed jobs and they use Java + Spring. I have to (re)learn Java.

It seems to me that this is an uncommon way of actually writing Java. I would say most people go from Java to Kotlin (
And probably stay there). Well, I'm not one of those people and I actually quite like this challenge. Something about
learning all the problems Java has that Kotlin is trying to solve makes me think that I will appreciate Kotlin even more
after actually working with Java for a while.
