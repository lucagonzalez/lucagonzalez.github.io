# This is my first post in here

I can't remember when I first started writing blogs. I think I was 11 or 12 when, for the first time, I created a
blogspot page, spent way too much time customising my blog theme and created my first post, thinking about the massive
audience I would reach if I just wrote about the right thing and I don't know if I spent more time thinking about what
to do for my first post or getting the HTML just right.

After months thinking about actually creating a blog and weeks setting it up just how I wanted, I spent a few days
thinking about what my first post should be. I remember coming up with the idea, it just appeared in my head: What
letter of the alphabet has more results on a Google search.
