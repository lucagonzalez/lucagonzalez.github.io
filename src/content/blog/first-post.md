# This is my first post in here

I can't remember when I first started writing blogs. I think I was 11 or 12 when, for the first time, I created a
blogspot page, spent way too much time customising my blog theme and created my first post, thinking about the massive
audience I would reach if I just wrote about the right thing and I don't know if I spent more time thinking about what
to do for my first post or getting the HTML just right.

After months thinking about actually creating a blog and weeks setting it up just how I wanted, I spent a few days
thinking about what my first post should be. I remember coming up with the idea, it just appeared in my head: What
letter of the alphabet has more results on a Google search. Until recently, Google would say how many results they've
found
and how quick they did
it ([I just found out some people were really pissed that they stopped doing it](https://support.google.com/websearch/thread/273693519/the-number-of-search-results-is-not-shown-anymore?hl=en))
and I thought it would be a good idea to come up with some graphs and insights about which letter of the alphabet had
more search results.

After stumbling upon this idea, I refined it even further in my head, days went by while I pondered about the colours I
wanted to use on the pie charts and what I would write about my findings. One day I had enough thinking, sat down and in
an afternoon I had everything done. It was exhilarating, my first blog post! Now I could finally become rich and famous
just by writing what's on my mind for all the world to see.
