# Creating prompts

Crafting a good prompt is not always easy, and it requires a bit of thought and planning to get a result that is good enough. In this article, we will explore the key considerations when generating prompts for ChatGPT and provide tips and best practices to help you get the most out of this powerful tool.

## What to look for

### Clarity

Stating clearly what you want from ChatGPT, as precisely as possible, is an excellent way to get exactly what you want. Making it easy for the chatbot to understand what you mean removes the possibility of any misunderstandings.

For example, you get different results from these two prompts:

```
Write a short description of a rose garden
```

```
Write a romantic description of a single rose in the middle of a garden
```

On the first prompt, ChatGPT responds technically, explaining precisely what a rose garden is. It even talks about its maintenance and tasks related to it.

Meanwhile, on the second prompt, ChatGPT knows it needs to generate something romantic about one single rose in the garden. It fills the response with adjectives and describes what one would feel by looking at a garden with a single rose standing out.

### Emphasis

In the previous example, it's clear how ChatGPT behaves when we deliberately point out some characteristics we want to emphasise.

By asking ChatGPT to write a romantic description, it completely forgot about the garden and went on about the rose, the breeze, the smell, and how the colours and beauty of the rose made the writer feel.

Emphasising what you expect from ChatGPT helps it stay on track and respond accordingly. It avoids any distractions and tangents it could go on about.

It's possible to emphasise just about anything, so ChatGPT follows your lead. Here are some examples:

* Sentiment
* Formality
* Directions to avoid

### Context

To get the most out of ChatGPT, it's better to give it some context before getting to the prompt. This can be done on the same prompt or sent as separate messages before the prompt.

Giving a specific context can help ChatGPT generate responses that are more compelling to us. It knows how specific professions or age groups would respond to the prompt, making it easier to get detailed responses based on our expectations.

**Impersonation**

An excellent way to give ChatGPT some context is to ask it to impersonate some profession or specific characters that can be created in the conversation, for example:

```
You now must respond as to how Steven would respond. Steven is a romance writer that loves flowers. He is a good writer that has written poetry in the past but now focuses on novels. He loves to give precise details about the scenes he writes about.

Me: Hey Steve! Could you describe a red rose that stands out in a rose garden that is receiving the sunlight from the sunset?

Steve:
```

This is a helpful way to fine-tune the responses to our prompts and make them more precise.

## What to avoid

Knowing what to avoid when creating prompts is as relevant as knowing what to do, and it’s important to remember that the response will be as good as the prompt is.

ChatGPT is only a language model and can easily give inadequate responses to badly created prompts. Here are some common mistakes and how to avoid them

### Ambiguity

Before going into a new conversation, define a clear goal for the response needed. It helps to remove ambiguity from the prompts and conversation.

It’s also important to use clear and easy-to-understand language, as it is easy to use jargon and technicalities when creating a prompt for concrete results.

### Jargon

Jargon can limit the ability of ChatGPT to generate a response, as ChatGPT may not be familiar with or able to use the specialised language in a meaningful way.

If jargon and technicalities are necessary, giving ChatGPT some context beforehand, either on the same message or in previous ones, is essential

### Too much information

Including too much information on the prompts could distract ChatGPT from the main topic, leaving crucial information behind.

The best way to align the response with a specific result is to break the prompt into different messages and use the flow of the conversation with ChatGPT to get a better result. This is also a way to fine-tune the response.

### Vagueness

Having prompts that leave the door open for ChatGPT to go on a tangent, it’s a sure way to have a response utterly different from expected.

Not being concise confuses the language model. It can focus on details that are irrelevant to the response but were included in the prompt with the same emphasis as all the other characteristics.


## Final Notes
Creating effective prompts for ChatGPT requires careful consideration, planning and clear expectations.

Key factors to consider when building prompts to ChatGPT are to strive for clarity, conciseness and focus, avoid ambiguity and open questions.

Following these tips and best practices, ChatGPT can instantly impact your life, generating high-quality responses that meet your needs and expectations.
